# CSS LAYOUT

**Controll ing the Position of El ements**

1. Normal flow: The paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page
2. Relative Positioning:This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
3. Absolute positioning:This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements.

## Floats:

1. left
_The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element_
2. right
_The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element._
3. both 
_Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element._
4. none
_Elements can touch either side._

**width :This sets the width of the columns.**
**margin This creates a gap between the columns**


_Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning._
_You can include multiple CSS files in one page._
