# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions


## Tables

**What's a Table?**
_A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results._

**example**
"<table>
<tr>= table row
<td>15</td>// table data
<td>15</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>45</td>
<td>60</td>
<td>45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td>
<td>90</td>
<td>90</td>
</tr>
</table>"

<th>The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)



_A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element._

_Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header)._

_You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes._

_For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>._







## Functions, Methods, and Objects


**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**


_Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements)._



**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**


_Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names._


**THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)**

_The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates._



**WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?**

_Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages._

_JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date._
