# Lists and Boxes in HTML,CSS,Desisions and Loop in JavaScript

## HTML provides us with three different types:

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
2.  Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.


**Examples for Lists :**

<!-- <html>
<head>
<title>Lists</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
<p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a
recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1tbs butter</li>
<li>2tbs cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
heat</li>
<li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
<li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
<li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
you are making an omelette)</li>
<li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the
heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
until served)</li>
</ol>
</body>
</html> -->

## CSS specification


    1. Border

    _Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide).The border separates the edge of one box from another._

    2. Margin

   _Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes._

    3. Padding

    **Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.**

## what is css can do ?
1. CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.
2.  You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
3.  You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
4. It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
5. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
6. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
7. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

## Operation in JavaScript:

_Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next._
_Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands._
_Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators._
_if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false._
_switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match)._
_Data types can be coerced from one type to another._
_All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy._
_There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements._


**example**:

<!-- var table = 3;
var operator= 'addition';
var i = 1;
var msg = ' ' ;
if (operator=== 'addition')
whi le (i < 11) {
msg += i + ' + ' + table + '
i++;
}
else {
while ( i < 11) {
msg += i + ' x ' + table + '
i++;
}
}
II Write the message into the page
var el = document.getElementByid{'bl ackboard');
el .innerHTML = msg; -->
