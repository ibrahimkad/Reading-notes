# HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

**Links**
_Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing._

**example:**
"<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>"

**Email Links**
"<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>"

**Opening Links in a New Window**
"<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">"

**Linking to a Sp ecific Part of the Sa me Page**
"<h1 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h1>"
"<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br />"
"<h2 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h2>"
"<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>"


_Links are created using the <a> element._
_The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to._
_If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs._
_You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field._
_You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to._


## Layout

"_<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page._"
_Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning._
_The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)_

## FUNCTIONS OBJECTS & METHODS


**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).


**Two way to declarate functions**

_First_
function area (width, height)
return width * height;
};
var size= area(3, 4) ;

_Second_
var ar ea = f unction(width, height) {
r eturn width * height;
} ;
var size = area(3, 4) ;
