 1. _HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled   brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning._
2. _Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more   about the content of that element._
 3. DOCTYPE tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
 4. You can add comments to your code between the    <!-- and --> markers.
5. The   id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
6. The   <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
7. <iframes>  cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
8. The   <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
9. Escape characters are used to include special   characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©
10. It's important to understand who your target audience  X is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
